h1. About Edlo

!https://github.com/ehamiter/Edlo/raw/master/edlo.png!

h3. Version 1.00

Edlo is a modified version of Stephen G. Hartke's "Aurulent Sans":http://www.dafont.com/aurulent-sans-mono.font, which I thought was beautiful, but hazardous for programming because the similarities between zeroes and ohs and ones and els were too close for comfort.

Edlo is the marriage of these edits and Mr. Hartke's original vision. The zero now has a dot in the middle of it, and the lowercase el has its left leg chopped off, making all of these characters unique.

h3. Installation

If you have "homebrew":http://http://brew.sh/ and "cask":http://http://caskroom.io/ installed, you can install it simply using

@brew tap caskroom/fonts           # If you've already tapped this cask, no need to do it again@
@brew cask install font-edlo@

If you would like to do it manually, click "Downloads" at the top right, then download the zipped source (.tar.gz or .zip). Unarchive and install "edlo.ttf" on your local machine.
