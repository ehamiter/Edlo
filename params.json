{"name":"Edlo","body":"Edlo is a modified version of Stephen G. Hartke's [Aurulent Sans](http://www.dafont.com/aurulent-sans-mono.font), which I thought was beautiful, but hazardous for programming because the similarities between zeroes and ohs and ones and els were too close for comfort.\r\n\r\nEdlo is the marriage of these edits and Mr. Hartke's original vision. The zero now has a dot in the middle of it, and the lowercase el has its left leg chopped off, making all of these characters unique.\r\n\r\n![Edlo in action](https://github.com/ehamiter/Edlo/raw/master/edlo.png )\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nDownload the zipped source (.tar.gz or .zip) at the top right of the screen, then unarchive and install `edlo.ttf` on your local machine.\r\n\r\n### Sublime Text 2 Specific\r\n\r\nI have these font options set up in my User File Preferences:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{  \r\n    [...]  \r\n    \"font_face\": \"Edlo\",  \r\n    \"font_options\":  \r\n    [  \r\n        \"gray_antialias\"  \r\n    ],  \r\n    \"font_size\": 14,  \r\n    [...]  \r\n}  \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Copyright and Trademark Information\r\n\r\nAurulent Sans: Copyright © 2007 Stephen G.
